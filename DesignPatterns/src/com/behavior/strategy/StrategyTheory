Strategy pattern allows us to encapsulate an algorithm in a class. So now
we can configure our context or main object with an object of this class, 
to change the algorithm used to perform given operation.

This is really helpful if y ou have many possible variations of an algorithm.

A good indication for applicability of strategy pattern is if
 we find different algorithms/behaviors in our methods which are elected with conditional
 statements like if-else or switch-case.
 
 Strategy design patterns are usually implemented in an inheritance hierachy so that we can 
 choose any one implementation and it will work with our main object/context as the interface
 same for all implementation
