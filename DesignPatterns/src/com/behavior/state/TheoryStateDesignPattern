State design pattern allows our objects to behave differently based on its current internal state.

2)))
     This pattern allows to define the state specific behaviours in seperate classes.
     
3)) 
     Operations defined in the class delegate to the current state objects's implementation of that behaviour.
     
4)))
	State transitions can be triggered by states themselves in which case each state knows about at least
	one other state's existance.
	
5)))
	 A benefit of this pattern is that new states and thus new behaviours can be added without changing our
	 main class.
